## About the project
This Github repository contains the Ruby code for the backend of Willfreight Express Cargo Services Limited's company website. The backend is built using the Sinatra web framework and is responsible for managing the logic for several key pages on the website, including the blog, about us page, CSR page, and request for quote (RFQ) page.

This backend has been designed to handle various functions, such as retrieving and displaying blog articles, providing information about the company and its corporate social responsibility initiatives, and processing requests for quotes from potential clients. It is built with a modular structure that allows for easy customization and expansion as the needs of the business evolve.

This project aims to provide an efficient and user-friendly web experience for both the company and its customers. The Ruby code is clean, well-organized, and adheres to best practices in software development. The repository includes detailed documentation on how to set up and run the project, making it easy for other developers to contribute to or modify the codebase.

## Technologies used
The  tools and frameworks utilized in the development of the project are as follows:

- The backend of the application is built using the [Sinatra web framework](https://sinatrarb.com/), which provides a lightweight and flexible solution for creating web applications. Active Record, a Ruby library for Object-Relational Mapping (ORM), is used to facilitate communication between the application and the database.

- To ensure the functionality and reliability of the application, we used [Postman](https://www.postman.com/) for testing. This tool provides a platform for comprehensive testing of the API endpoints and is used to validate the functionality of the backend.

- We also utilized [dbdiagram.io](https://dbdiagram.io/home), an online tool for visualizing entity relationships, to create a visual representation of the database schema. This tool allows for the quick and easy creation of an ER diagram, making it simple to understand the relationships between the various entities in the database.

By leveraging these technologies, we have developed a robust and scalable backend for the application. The code is modular, easy to understand, and adheres to best practices in software development. The repository includes detailed documentation on how to set up and run the project, making it easy for other developers to contribute to or modify the codebase.
